/* 
                    'this' keyword in JavaScript allows to decide which object should be focal when invoking a function or a method.
                    It allows to reuse functions in different contexts or with different objects.

                    Sometimes it is difficult to tell what the 'this' keyword is referencing to.
                    One can tell by looking at "where the function which is using the 'this ' keyword was invoked".

                    Lets see in detail the different ways of evaluating this keyword.
*/

// 1.Implicit Binding

const user = {
  name: "ritik",
  age: "22",
  welcome() {
    alert(`Hello ${this.name} `);
  },
};

user.welcome();

/*
                    So where does the method welcome() having 'this' keyword is invoked.
                    user.welcome()
                    Here look at left side of . 
                    What you found is - user. So here this is referencing to the user object. 
                    It is as if 'this.name' in welcome() method is changed to 'user.name' . 
                */

// 2.Explicit Binding

function welcome() {
  alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);
}

const user = {
  name: "ritik",
  age: "22",
};

/*
                Here we can not do user.welcome().
                So question is how to invoke welcome() so that 'this' refers to user object.
                
                Their is where call,apply and bind methods comes in picture. 
                --Every function in JavaScript contains a call,apply and bind method for this purpose.--
            */

//              Let see how to use call() method to invoke welcome() with user object.

welcome.call(user);

/*
                The first argument passed to call() will be what the 'this' keyword in welcome() is referencing to.
                Now what if welcome() method need some other arguments. Let see :

            */
function welcome(state, country) {
  alert(`Hello ${this.name} from ${state} in ${country}`);
}

const user = {
  name: "ritik",
  age: "22",
};

//              Now how to pass country argument using call()

welcome.call(user, "Delhi", "India");

//              If there are other arguments to be passed to a function then in call() it is passed one by one.

//             Now what about apply(). apply also works in same manner but takes other arguments in one single array.

welcome.apply(user, ["Delhi", "India"]);

/*
               bind() is exact same as call() but instead of invoking the function immediately it returns a new function which 
               we can invoke later anytime  
 */

//3. Lexical Binding

let section = {
  title: "CSE",
  students: ["Ritik", "Gaurav", "Alice"],

  showList() {
    this.students.forEach(function (student) {
      alert(`${student} , ${this.title}`); //Error: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined
    });
  },
};

section.showList();

/*output
                Ritik, undefined
                Gaurav, undefined
                Alice, undefined
            */

/*.
              .so why does 'this.title' giving us undefined? Where the function is invoked? function is anynomous 
              and passed to forEach so we dont know. Only we know that 'this' is not getting its context and so it is udefined. */

/* Solution :  with new arrow function 'this' keyword can use the context or refer to parent function or scope. Here this is using 
              lexical binding. */

let section = {
  title: "CSE",
  students: ["Ritik", "Gaurav", "Alice"],

  showList() {
    this.students.forEach((student) => {
      alert(`${student} , ${this.title}`);
    });
  },
};

section.showList();

//4. window Binding

function getAge() {
  alert(`My age is ${this.age}`);
}

getAge();

//            output : age is undefined
//            No error why?
//            By default JavaScript refers this to window object.

window.age = 23;

getAge();
//output :    My age is 23

/*
              To avoid this behaviour 'use strict'. In the Strict mode if 'this' is not defined it will give undefined 
              but not refer to window object
 */
